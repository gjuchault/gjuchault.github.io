During one week-end (11/20 and 11/21), we participed (along with four members of the robotics team) to an electronics hackathon. The subject was « Embedded systems serving the environment ».

We were five to participate : two developpers (pretty good in electronics), one project manager/math guy, one specialized in electronic and me (development). Concurrent teams where coming from all over the France, and a majority of the teams were from the hosting school.

## Provided hardware

The organizers provided us WiFi of course, a Raspberry Pi and an AIM Kit (similar to RPi with a touchscreen).  They also had a few activities to let us entertain during the week-end (food, foosball, etc.). One of the partner (EDF - which provides electricity/gas all over the France) allowed us to use its Open Data website. The API (REST/JSON) contained some relevant informations.

## Our project

We worked on a proof of concept called « Flux ». The concept was the making of a small box that everyone could buy and put on its roof. This box was supposed to gather solar exposition and wind exposition. Each day, the module would send data to a server. After a year, a report was sent by email with a precise estimation on the rentability of the installation of a solar panel and/or a wind turbine.

What we liked in this idea is that you could use this product either for a personal use, or (if you're managing a city/state/etc. - any collectivity) you could buy a few boxes and put them all over the city/state/etc.. After a year, you could see what would be the benefits for your people to use solar panels/wind turbines.

The RPi was used to make the controller (gathering the data/convert lumens to kWh and con convert m/s to kWh and sending the data).
The AIM Kit was used to simulate the data source : sun/wind (two sliders and a send button).

## What I did

Actually, I got the base idea (inspired by Google Sunroof). I also created the server and a admin panel that would show a realtime map of every module installed. I also helped on the math part (lumens -> kWh and m/s -> kWh). My friends made electronics, the client side (on the RPi), the math and the presentation of the project to the jury.

## Conclusion

The event was great. Our team was solid, we did some pretty good job. Even if we didn't win anything; I really enjoyed the event.
